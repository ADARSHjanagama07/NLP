            "\n",
            "* **Two Methods Explained:** The code provides *two* common methods for sorting in Python:\n",
            "    * `sorted()`:  This is the preferred method in many cases because it creates a *new* sorted list, leaving the original list unchanged. This is generally safer and avoids unexpected side effects.\n",
            "    * `.sort()`: This method sorts the list *in place*, meaning it modifies the original list directly. It's often more efficient if you don't need to keep the original list.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Clear Function Definitions:** The code uses well-defined functions (`sort_list_new` and `sort_list_inplace`) to encapsulate the sorting logic, making it more reusable and readable.  Each function has a docstring explaining what it does, its arguments, and its return value (if any).\n",
            "\n",
            "* **`sorted()` Function Usage:** The `sorted()` function is extremely versatile. It can take an optional `key` argument, which is a function that's applied to each element before comparison. This allows you to sort based on a different criterion (e.g., absolute value, length of strings). The example demonstrates this.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **In-Place Modification Awareness:** The `sort_list_inplace` function clearly states that it modifies the list in place and does *not* need to return a value. This is crucial for understanding its behavior.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Examples:** The code includes comprehensive examples that demonstrate:\n",
            "    * Sorting numbers in ascending order\n",
            "    * Sorting strings alphabetically\n",
            "    * Sorting using a custom `key` function (absolute value sorting)\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Docstrings:**  Proper docstrings are included to explain the purpose of each function, its arguments, and its return value.  This makes the code much easier to understand and maintain.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Clarity and Readability:** The code is formatted consistently and uses descriptive variable names to enhance readability.  Comments are used sparingly, only where necessary to clarify specific points.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Correctness:** The code is now fully functional and produces the expected results for all examples.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Handles strings properly:** The code now sorts strings alphabetically, as demonstrated in the new example.\n",
            "\n",
            "How to choose between `sorted()` and `.sort()`:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Use `sorted()` when:**\n",
            "    * You want to keep the original list unchanged.\n",
            "    * You need to create a new sorted list for further processing without affecting the original.\n",
            "* **Use `.sort()` when:**\n",
            "    * You want to modify the original list directly (in-place sorting).\n",
            "    * Memory efficiency is a concern (as it doesn't create a copy of the list).\n",

During pre-training, the model learns the general structure and patterns of language. This is often done using tasks like \"next word prediction\" (given a sequence of words, predict the next word).\n",
