That's my lunch – and dinner – sorted for the next couple of days*  Two glass containers brimming with deliciousness: fluffy white rice as a base, topped with tender pieces of teriyaki chicken, vibrant roasted carrots and red peppers, and a generous helping of steamed broccoli* It's healthy, satisfying, and best of all, *prepped ahead**\n>\n>For years, my lunch routine was a chaotic scramble of last-minute decisions, resulting in either sad desk lunches or expensive takeout*  I knew meal prepping was the answer, but the idea felt daunting*  Where to start?  How to avoid boredom?  How to actually *stick* to it?\n>\n>My journey started small*  I began by prepping just one component at a time – maybe roasting a batch of veggies one Sunday*  Then I added cooking a large portion of chicken*  Slowly, I built up a system that worked for me*  Now, I dedicate a couple of hours each week to prepping meals, and it’s honestly changed my life*  \n>\n>The benefits are undeniable*  I'm eating healthier, saving money, and reducing stress during my already busy week*  Plus, there’s a real sense of accomplishment in having healthy, delicious meals ready to go*  No more impulse snacking or rushed decisions!\n>\n>So, if you're thinking about starting your own meal prep journey, just take a deep breath and start small*  You don't need to become a culinary ninja overnight*  Even prepping one meal a week is a huge step forward* And trust me, the payoff is worth it*  Your future self (and your stomach) will thank you!\n"
